# Gemini Voices API

> Source: https://ai.google.dev/api/voices/

The Voices API allows you to create custom voices from natural language prompts (Voice Design) or from reference audio and speaker consent recordings (Voice Replication), as well as list, retrieve, and manage custom and prebuilt voices for Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis.

## CreateVoice

post  https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/voices 

Creates a custom voice from a natural-language prompt (`VOICE_TYPE_PROMPTED`) or from reference and consent audio recordings (`VOICE_TYPE_REPLICATED`).

  * Request body
  * Response



### Request body

The request body contains data with the following structure:

voice Voice (required)

Required. The voice to create. `voice.model` is optional; if omitted, the service selects the default voice creation model. Output-only fields on `Voice` (`id`, `key`, `expire_time`, `usage`) are ignored if set.

store boolean (optional)

Optional. Whether the created voice is persisted and managed by Google. * When `true`, Google stores the voice and returns `Voice.id` (for example, `voice_abc123def456`), which can be managed via `GetVoice`, `ListVoices`, and `DeleteVoice` and referenced by ID in synthesis requests. Stored voices expire after 1 year of inactivity; using a stored voice in speech synthesis or as a `base_voice` in `CreateVoice` extends its `expire_time`. Projects are subject to a maximum active stored voice quota; exceeding the quota returns `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`. * When `false` (default), the voice is not stored by Google and `Voice.key` (for example, `voicekey_...`) is returned for client-side storage and synthesis. Optional discovery metadata fields on `voice` are not persisted or returned when `store` is `false`. * Required to be `true` when `voice.type` is `"prompted"` (otherwise fails with `INVALID_ARGUMENT`).

### Response

If successful, the response body contains data with the following structure:

type VoiceType (required)

Required. The type of the voice. In `CreateVoice`, must be `"replicated"` or `"prompted"`. In `ListVoices` responses, may also be `"prebuilt"`.

#### Possible values

  * `replicated`

A custom voice replicated from a reference audio sample and speaker consent recording.

  * `prompted`

A custom voice generated from a natural-language text prompt (optionally editing or remixing a `base_voice`).

  * `prebuilt`

A built-in system voice from Google's voice catalog (e.g., `Puck`, `Charon`). Returned in responses; cannot be specified as the type in `CreateVoice`.




id string (optional)

Output only. The unique identifier of the voice. * For Google-managed custom voices (`store = true`), this is a generated ID with prefix `voice_` (for example, `voice_abc123def456`). Pass `voices/{id}` as the `name` in `GetVoice` and `DeleteVoice`, and pass `{id}` directly to `SpeechConfig.voice_config.voice` (or `SpeechConfig.voice`) during speech synthesis. * For prebuilt catalog voices (`"prebuilt"` returned by `ListVoices`), this is the speaker name (for example, `Puck` or `Charon`). * Unset when `CreateVoice` is called with `store = false`.

model string (optional)

Optional. The model used to design or replicate the voice. If omitted in `CreateVoice`, defaults to the latest supported voice design model. Returned in `CreateVoice`, `GetVoice`, and `ListVoices` responses for custom voices (`"prompted"` and `"replicated"`); unset for `"prebuilt"` voices. Created voices can be synthesized across any supported TTS synthesis model.

key string (optional)

Output only. The client-managed voice replication key (with prefix `voicekey_`). Returned only by `CreateVoice` when `type` is `"replicated"` and `store` is `false`. Pass this key to `SpeechConfig.voice_config.voice` (or `SpeechConfig.voice`) during speech synthesis.

expire_time string (optional)

Output only. The timestamp at which a custom stored voice (`store = true`) or replicated voice key (`store = false`) expires. For custom stored voices (`store = true`), this expiration time is extended when the voice is used for speech synthesis or as a `base_voice` in `CreateVoice`. Unset for prebuilt catalog voices (`"prebuilt"`), which do not expire.

display_name string (optional)

Optional. User-provided display name for a stored voice (`store = true`), or the catalog name for a prebuilt voice.

prompted PromptedVoice (optional)

Parameters for prompted voice generation. Required in `CreateVoice` when `type` is `"prompted"`. Returned in `CreateVoice`, `GetVoice`, and `ListVoices` responses for prompted voices.

Parameters for prompted voice generation. Required in `CreateVoice` when `type` is `"prompted"`. Returned in `CreateVoice`, `GetVoice`, and `ListVoices` responses for prompted voices.
